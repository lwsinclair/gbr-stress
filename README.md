# Torres Strait Coral Reef Stress Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of Great Barrier Reef coral stress monitoring data for the Torres Strait region, using data from NOAA's Coral Reef Watch program.

## Overview

This project provides a professional Jupyter notebook that analyzes 40 years (1985-2025) of sea surface temperature (SST) and coral stress data from the Torres Strait region of the Great Barrier Reef. The analysis creates NOAA-style visualizations highlighting periods of significant coral stress events.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Processes daily SST measurements spanning 1985-2025
- **Professional Visualization**: Creates publication-quality charts matching NOAA's styling standards
- **Stress Event Highlighting**: Identifies and visualizes coral bleaching warnings and alert-level events
- **Climatological Context**: Includes long-term monthly temperature averages for comparison
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provides detailed statistics on temperature patterns and stress events

## Data Source

The analysis uses data from **NOAA's Coral Reef Watch** program:

- **Dataset**: Torres Strait Virtual Station Data
- **URL**: https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/vs/data/torres_strait.txt
- **Provider**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
- **Program**: Coral Reef Watch
- **Coverage**: Daily measurements from January 1985 to September 2025
- **Parameters**:
  - Sea Surface Temperature (Min, Max, 90th percentile)
  - Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies
  - Degree Heating Weeks (DHW)
  - Bleaching Alert Area indicators

### Data Description

The Torres Strait dataset contains the following key measurements:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `SST_MIN` | Daily minimum sea surface temperature (Â°C) |
| `SST_MAX` | Daily maximum sea surface temperature (Â°C) |
| `SST@90th_HS` | Sea surface temperature at 90th percentile hotspot (Â°C) |
| `SSTA@90th_HS` | Sea surface temperature anomaly at 90th percentile (Â°C) |
| `DHW_from_90th_HS>1` | Degree Heating Weeks from 90th percentile threshold |
| `BAA_7day_max` | 7-day maximum Bleaching Alert Area |

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib requests
```

### Running the Analysis

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lwsinclair/gbr-stress.git
cd gbr-stress
```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook torres_strait_analysis.ipynb
```

3. Run all cells to:
   - Download the latest data from NOAA
   - Process and analyze the dataset
   - Generate the visualization
   - Display summary statistics

## Key Results

The analysis reveals:

- **40 years of continuous monitoring** from 1985-2025
- **Temperature trends** and seasonal patterns in the Torres Strait
- **Coral stress events** including bleaching warnings and alert-level conditions
- **Climatological baseline** for temperature comparisons
- **Statistical summaries** of stress event frequency and intensity

## Visualization

The main output is a comprehensive time series chart featuring:

- **SST Time Series**: Daily 90th percentile sea surface temperatures
- **Temperature Range**: Min-max daily temperature envelope
- **Climatology**: Monthly average temperatures for reference
- **Stress Periods**: Color-coded background highlighting for:
  - ðŸŸ  **Bleaching Warning** (SSTA > 1Â°C)
  - ðŸ”´ **Alert Level 2** (DHW â‰¥ 8Â°C-weeks)
- **DHW Timeline**: Degree Heating Weeks on secondary axis
- **Reference Lines**: Bleaching threshold temperatures

## Scientific Context

### Coral Bleaching Thresholds

The analysis uses established coral bleaching thresholds:

- **Bleaching Warning**: Sea surface temperature anomaly > 1Â°C above long-term average
- **Alert Level 1**: Degree Heating Weeks â‰¥ 4Â°C-weeks
- **Alert Level 2**: Degree Heating Weeks â‰¥ 8Â°C-weeks (severe bleaching likely)

### Torres Strait Significance

The Torres Strait represents a critical region for coral reef monitoring as it:

- Connects the Great Barrier Reef to Indo-Pacific coral systems
- Experiences significant thermal stress events
- Serves as an early warning indicator for reef-wide bleaching events
- Contains important cultural and ecological values

## Data Quality & Limitations

- **Temporal Coverage**: Daily data from 1985-present with minimal gaps
- **Spatial Resolution**: 5km satellite-derived measurements
- **Validation**: Data undergoes NOAA quality control procedures
- **Limitations**: Satellite measurements may differ from in-situ temperatures
